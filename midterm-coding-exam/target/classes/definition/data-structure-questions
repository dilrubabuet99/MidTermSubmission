Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:



why do we need data structure?
-To Store multiple data and data types in one object , we need data structure
What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
-Add, create, remove, search, delete etc
List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
-everywhere like operating system, machine learning,data base, design, graphics etc
what is an Array?
Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.
what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
-In array ,length is fixed in array and we cannot entry more than declared number of the array length.In array, we cannot also entry multiple data types also.To overcome these, ArrayList is introduced
what is LinkedList?
-It is a list that uses nodes and no extra array.It saves a lot of memory .
How is an Array different from Linked List?
-In Array , behind each Array there are multiple Arrays, but in LinkedList, we have only nodes and we can delete, remove ,add values more easily.
what is queue?
-A collection class that uses FIFO& LILO.
what is stack?
-A collection class that uses FILO& LIFO.
what is FIFO and LIFO?
- FIFO is FIRST IN FIRST OUT.
LIFO is LAST IN FIRST OUT.
what is the order of complexity?
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
-by searching synchronized way like element one after another and once find ,then to stop.
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
-to search through one after another.
what is tree in data structure?
-it is  a collection,where there  a parent and a child.
what is graph in data structure?
-it is a collection where nodes are connected and we can move between two nodes in a multiple way.
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
-Hashmap,linkedHashmap, LinkedArray
How HashMap works in java?
-It takes in key,value pair.ANd key value is unique .
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
-It is an exception handling for errors that occurs when handling Arrays.
When we try to access an Arary index that is  not in existence /not available in array is known as ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
-Array is used for  storing and accessing data , linkedList is used to manipulate data.
What is DFS and BFS?
What is Recursion?
-A method that calls itself.
What are linear and non linear data Structures?
-linear data structure has data elements connected to each other so that elements are arranged in a sequential manner and each element is connected to the element in front of it and behind it. Examples are Array,ArrayList,LinkedList etc
All the data elements in non linear data structure can not be traversed in single run. Examples of non linear data structures are Trees and Graphs.
What is Big-(O)-notation?
-Based on complexity, Big-(o) is a special code is that used to measure how complex the code is.
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
